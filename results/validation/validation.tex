    In this chapter we wish to demonstrate that our implementations work as
    expected by reproducing known results from the litterature.
    We will in this section limit our attention to small systems.

    \section{The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator}
        An excellent starting point is the one-dimensional harmonic
        oscillator described using the discretized one-dimensional quantum dot
        system as discussed in \autoref{sec:one-dim-qd}.
        A study done by \citeauthor{zanghellini_2004}
        \cite{zanghellini_2004, skattum2013time, kristiansen2017time}
        explores the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree-Fock method
        on the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator system for two particles
        compared to a semi-analytic result.\footnote{%
            Semi-analytic as the time-evolution is solved numerically.
        }
        In this study the external potential is given by
        \begin{align}
            \hat{v} = \half \omega^2\hat{x}^2,
        \end{align}
        where atomic units are used.
        \citeauthor{zanghellini_2004} uses a monochromatic, dipole, laser field
        described by
        \begin{align}
            E(t) = E_0\sin(\Omega t)\hat{x},
        \end{align}
        which is active for the entire simulation.
        The Coulomb interaction is described by the shielded Coulomb interaction
        from \autoref{eq:shielded-coulomb} with $\alpha = 1$ and the screening
        parameter set to $a = 0.25$.
        In the simulation done by \citeauthor{zanghellini_2004} the parameters
        are chosen to be $\omega = 0.25$, $E_0 = 1$ and $\Omega =
        8\omega$.
        The simulation is run on a one-dimensional grid where $x \in [-10, 10]$.
        We use a basis of $L = 20$ spin-orbitals, that is, the $L / 2 = 10$
        first one-dimensional harmonic oscillator orbitals found by
        diagonalizing the one-body Hamiltonian.

        In \autoref{fig:one-body-density-zanghellini} we plot the ground
        state one-body particle densities using Hartree-Fock and CISD, i.e.,
        full configuration interaction for two particles.
        In the lower plot in \autoref{fig:one-body-density-zanghellini} we
        demonstrate that CCSD reproduces the exact solution as achieved from
        configuration interaction to a high precision.
        We've listed the ground state energies in \autoref{tab:gs-zanghellini}
        for the different solver methods.
        We compute the relative error by
        \begin{align}
            e_{rel} = \frac{\abs{E - E_{ref}}}{\abs{E_{ref}}},
        \end{align}
        where $E_{ref} = \SI{0.8247}{\hartree}$ as the exact value from
        \citeauthor{zanghellini_2004} \cite{zanghellini_2004}.
        Note that the relative error is computed for the rounded values.

        Before moving on to more exotic systems, we will look shortly at the
        performance of CCD and CID applied to the same one-dimensional harmonic
        oscillator system.
        The reason for doing this is to demonstrate the importance of the
        singles excitation operator.
        Looking at \autoref{fig:one-body-density-doubles-zanghellini} we can see
        how the doubles approximations CID and CCD with the harmonic oscillator
        basis are quite far from the full configuration-interaction benchmark.
        With a Hartree-Fock basis CID and CCD are much better at reproducing the
        full configuration-interaction result.
        This demonstrates the effectiveness of Brillouin's theorem by moving to
        the optimal single-reference determinant found in Hartree-Fock.
        However, this does not completely remove the need for a singles
        operator.

        In \autoref{fig:overlap-doubles-zanghellini} we show CID and CCD with
        and without a Hartree-Fock basis is unable to give a good reconstruction
        of the exact solution from full configuration interaction.
        The lack of singles excitations become glaringly apparent once we start
        the time-evolution of the system.
        This can be seen as an effect of the laser field being described by a
        singles operator.
        It is therefore likely that a singles-excitation operator best describes
        this interaction and the doubles approximation will have problems
        properly depicting the dynamics.

    \section{Two-electron molecule}
        In a study on the optical response of molecules subject to an
        intense laser fields done by \citeauthor{li_2005} \cite{li_2005} a
        comparison of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method and the
        time-dependent full configuration interaction\footnote{%
            Note that \citeauthor{li_2005} denotes the time-dependent
            full-configuration interaction method by: ``the time-dependent
            Schrödinger equation''.
        } is performed.
        This provides us with an ample opportunity to repeat the
        experiments in order for us to verify our methods.
        We will therefore reproduce parts of the study done by
        \citeauthor{li_2005} using TDCISD, TDHF, TDCCSD, and OATDCCD.

        We'll look at the smallest molecule \ch{H2}, that is, the Hydrogen
        molecule with two electrons.
        This means that TDCISD, TDCCSD, and OATDCCD should produce exact
        results for the single-particle basis that is used.
        %That is, we compute
        %\begin{align}
        %    \tilde{\vfg{d}}^{p}_{q}(t)
        %    = \mel*{\tilde{\phi}_p(t)}{\hat{\vfg{d}}}{\phi_q(t)}
        %    = \tilde{C}_{p\alpha}(t)
        %    \mel*{\chi_{\alpha}}{\hat{\vfg{d}}}{\chi_{\beta}}
        %    C_{\beta q}(t),
        %\end{align}
        %as the basis transformed dipole matrix elements.
        %Having computed the one-body density matrix $\densityten^{q}_{p}(t)$
        %from OATDCCD, we can find the induced dipole-moment along the
        %$z$-axis by picking out the $z$-component of the dipole elements,
        %that is,
        %\begin{align}
        %    \expval{z(t)}
        %    &= \densityten^{q}_{p}(t) \tilde{z}^{p}_{q}(t),
        %\end{align}
        %where $\tilde{z}^{p}_{q}(t)$ is the $z$-component of
        %$\tilde{\vfg{d}}^{p}_{q}(t)$.
        We express \ch{H2} in $14$ Gaussian type orbitals, that is, the
        $6-311++G(d, p)$ basis set, with an equilibrium geometry of $R_e =
        \SI{0.7354}{\angstrom} \approx \SI{1.3897}{\bohr}$.
        We center the molecule around the origin with each atom located at
        $\pm R_e/2$ in the $z$-direction zero for the $x$- and
        $y$-direction.
        We then make the basis set doubly occupied by including spin.
        The basis is run through a general Hartree-Fock solver which finds
        the Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals and changes to this basis.
        The laser pulse used by \citeauthor{li_2005} is
        \begin{align}
            \hat{\vfg{d}} \cdot \vfg{f}(t)
            = \hat{\vfg{d}} \cdot \vfg{E}(t)\sin(\omega t),
            \label{eq:li-field}
        \end{align}
        where $\hat{\vfg{d}}$ is the dipole operator in three dimensions and
        the envelope $\vfg{E}(t) = E(t)\vfg{\epsilon}$ with $\vfg{\epsilon}$
        as the polarization vector.
        We let the envelope cycle as a function of time by
        \begin{align}
            E(t) = \begin{cases}
                (\omega t / 2\pi) E_m, & \omega t \in [0, 2\pi], \\
                E_m, & \omega t \in [2\pi, 4\pi], \\
                [3 - \omega t / (2\pi)] E_m, & \omega t \in [4\pi, 6\pi], \\
                0, & \omega t \neq [0, 6\pi],
            \end{cases}
            \label{eq:li-laser}
        \end{align}
        where we set $E_m = \SI{0.07}{\hartree}$ and $\omega =
        \SI{0.1}{\hartree/\hslash}$.
        This envelope is slightly unconventional as compared to the more
        common envelope functions discussed in \autoref{subsec:envelope}.
        A plot of the laser field during the simulation is shown in
        \autoref{fig:li-laser}.

            \caption{In this figure we've plotted the laser field from

            \citeauthor{li_2005} \cite{li_2005}.}
            \label{fig:li-laser}

        In our programs the dipole moment is defined with a positive sign,
        which means that we need to introduce a negative sign in the
        envelope or the polarization vector to include the negative charge
        of the electrons.
        We have chosen to set the polarization vector along the negative
        $z$-direction.
        A plot of the instantaneous dipole moment of \ch{H2} in the
        $z$-direction where we simulate for a total of $t_f =
        \SI{225}{\hslash/\hartree}$ with the laser turned on from start
        until $2\pi/\omega \approx \SI{62.8}{\hslash/\hartree}$ is shown in
        \autoref{fig:dipole-moment-li}.
        A by-eye comparison of the top figure in
        \autoref{fig:dipole-moment-li} with figure 4 in \citetitle{li_2005}
        \cite{li_2005} shows that we are in perfect agreement with the
        results of \citeauthor{li_2005}.
        In the lower figure we show the absolute error in the induced dipole
        moment as calculated by the TDCCSD and OATDCCD methods compared with
        the exact full configuration interaction solution.
        The convergence threshold of the Gauss-Legendre integrator was set
        to $\num{1e-6}$ which is larger than the absolute error between the
        methods.
        We therefore conclude that TDCCSD and OATDCCD reproduce the exact
        results to a satisfying degree.

        It is interesting to note in the top figure in
        \autoref{fig:dipole-moment-li} that the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
        method performs surprisingly well.
        There are small discrepancies, but at the intensity we use for our
        laser the mean-field approximation performs excellently.
        However, we expect that as the intensity increases, this method will
        prove inferior to the correlated methods.
