\chapter{Stability}
    \label{chap:stability}
    In this chapter we'll explore some aspects of the stability of our developed
    methods.
    We also seek to answer the question of why we should even consider the more
    complicated orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster methods as
    opposed to the known time-dependent coupled-cluster methods with static
    orbitals.
