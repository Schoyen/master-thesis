\section{One-dimensional quantum dots}
    In this section we'll demonstrate some results for the one-dimensional
    quantum dot subject to various potentials.

    \subsection{Eigenstates}
        As discussed in \autoref{subsec:discretizing-the-odqd} our discrete
        solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation for the one-dimensional quantum dot
        allows us to explore arbitrary time-independent potentials, but at the
        cost of numerical errors.
