\chapter{Atoms and molecules}
    In this chapter we'll discuss ground state and time evolution of various
    atomic and molecular systems.

    \section{Ground state energies}
        The basis sets for the atomic systems were built using PySCF
        \cite{pyscf} along with PySCF's implementation of the restricted
        Hartree-Fock scheme.
        We have computed the ground state energy using the NOCCD procedure and
        compare with literature in \autoref{tab:gs-atoms}.
        The relative error is computed by
        \begin{align}
            e_{rel}
            = \frac{\abs{E_{NOCCD} - E_{ref}}}{\abs{E_{ref}}},
        \end{align}
        as done by \citeauthor{hogberget2013quantum}
        \cite{hogberget2013quantum}.
        From \autoref{tab:gs-atoms} we see that the reference energies are
        consistenly lower than our ground state calculations using the NOCCD
        method for atoms He through Ar.
        However, for the case of Kr we suddenly achieve lower values using NOCCD
        than the reference result.
        The reason for this is that the latter result for Kr is achieved using
        Hartree-Fock \cite{partridge-nhf}, and indeed this corresponds well with
        the restricted Hartree-Fock results from PySCF \cite{pyscf}.

            energies from their implementation of the restricted Hartree-Fock in
            $E_{RHF}*$.
            The reference results $E_{ref}$ are found from
            \citeauthor{Degroote2013} \cite{Degroote2013} for atoms He
            through Ar, and \citeauthor{partridge-nhf} \cite{partridge-nhf} for
            Kr.
            We have rounded the results to four decimal places for all presented
            results as this corresponds our convergence criteria for the NOCCD
            calculation.}
