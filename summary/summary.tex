    \section{Future prospects}
        \label{sec:future-work}
        The future prospects from this thesis can be divided into two parts: the
        continued development of the methods and solvers, and the application of
        the methods to unexplored systems.
        We will discuss these two prospect categories separately.

        \subsection{Development of the libraries}
            In this thesis we have explored a significant amount of methodology
            and techniques used in real-time electronic many-body theories, but
            we have in no way exhausted the space of possibilities.
            Furthermore, much of our work is written in such a way that we wish
            to inspire continued development by other students and researchers,
            and we will hopefully be able to publish a software specification.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Differential equations.
                \item Grid-solvers.
                \item OATDCCDT.
                \item TDCCSDT.
                \item Three-dimensional quantum dots.
                \item Magnetic fields with spin-coupling.
                \item Relativistic considerations.
                \item Optimzation using C++ or Julia.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Application to physical and chemical systems}
            We have in this thesis and the thesis by \citeauthor{greg-winther}
            \cite{greg-winther} demonstrated a wide range of applications of the
            libraries we have developed.
            One of the main difficulties in writing this thesis has been the
            downscaling of the amount of results to present.
            There are a multitude of systems that we have not had the time to
            include between the four covers that our theses consist of.
            Along with our work there is also two manuscripts in preparation.
            The first manuscript concerns itself with the stability of
            time-dependent coupled-cluster methods \cite{oa-stability} and
            serves as a response to the work by
            \citeauthor{pedersen2018symplectic} \cite{pedersen2018symplectic}.
            The second manuscript is an extensive study on the time-evolution of
            quantum dots \cite{td-quantum-dots} and seeks to apply the developed
            framework to studies on various quantum dot systems.
            Therefore, it is not surprising that much of this work will be
            presented in later studies as part of \citeauthor{greg-winther}'s
            and my PhD-studies at the Centre for Computing in Science Education.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Large atoms.
                \item Large molecules.
                \item Atoms, molecules and quantum-dots subject to magnetic
                    fields. Spin-orbit coupling.
                \item Real-time fission and fusion simulations.
            \end{enumerate}
