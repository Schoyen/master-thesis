    \label{chap:hf}
    One can not tackle the subject of many-body theory without a discussion of
    the Hartree-Fock method. It serves as an excellent initial approximation,
    and in many cases the \emph{only} approximation, to the many-body
    wavefunction for a given system. It is a rather cheap method, in terms of
    computational intensity, and explains much of the underlying physics of a
    given system of many particles.

    \section{Time-independent Hartree-Fock theory}
        Starting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation,
        \begin{align}
            \hamil\ket{\Psi} = \energy\ket{\Psi},
        \end{align}
        where $\hamil$ is the electronic Hamiltonian with one- and two-body
        operators.
        We know that the ground state of the one-body Hamiltonian will be a
        single Slater determinant as demonstrated in
        \autoref{sec:slater-determinants}.
        If the two-body interactions are weak, we can treat these contributions
        perturbatively and a single Slater determinant will serve as a good
        approximation to the full many-body wave function.\footnote{%
            We will see that it does not take much before the two-body
            interaction becomes a little more than just a small perturbation.
        }
        This motivates the approximation that the many-body wave function
        $\ket{\Psi}$ can be approximated by a single Slater determinant, viz.
        \begin{align}
            \ket{\Psi} = \ket{\slat} = \ket{\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_N},
        \end{align}
        where the \emph{molecular orbitals}\footnote{%
            The term molecular orbitals will be used exclusively to denote the
            ``Hartree-Fock'' orbitals.
        } $\brac{\phi_i}_{i = 1}^{N}$ are the
        primary unknowns, subject to the constraint that they are orthonormal,
        \begin{align}
            \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j} = \delta_{ij}
            \implies
            \braket{\slat} = 1.
        \end{align}

        \subsection{The non-canonical Hartree-Fock equations}
            Starting from the variational principle, we define the energy
            functional
            \begin{align}
                \energyfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}}
                \equiv \mel{\slat}{\hamil}{\slat}
                =
                \mel{\phi_i}{\onehamil}{\phi_i}
                + \half\mel{\phi_i\phi_j}{\twohamil}{\phi_i\phi_j}_{AS},
                \label{eq:energy_func_hf}
            \end{align}
            found from the definition of the reference energy in
            \autoref{subsec:reference-energy}.
            Our task is now to find the molecular orbitals $\brac{\phi_i}$ that
            minimizes the energy functional, i.e., we find the stationary points
            of the energy functional as discussed in
            \autoref{sec:variational-principle}.
            As the energy functional $\energyfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}}$ does not
            incorporate the constraint that the molecular orbitals should be
            orthonormal, we use Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers.
            This yields the Lagrangian functional
            \begin{align}
                \lagrangianfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}, \lambda}
                &= \energyfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}}
                - \lambda_{ji}\para{
                    \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    - \delta_{ij}
                },
            \end{align}
            where $\lambda_{ji}$ are Lagrange multipliers, one for each
            constraint.
            As the Lagrangian functional is real and the constraint is
            Hermitian, the Lagrange multipliers can be chosen Hermitian as well.

            \begin{proof}[%
                    Proof that the Lagrange multipliers can be chosen Hermitian%
                ]
                We follow closely the derivation done by Mayer
                \cite{mayer2003simple}, we start by noticing that the constraint is
                Hermitian, i.e.,
                \begin{align}
                    \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j} - \delta_{ij}
                    = \braket{\phi_j}{\phi_i}^{*} - \delta_{ji}.
                \end{align}
                As of now we have two independent Lagrange multipliers; one for the
                overlap $\braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}$ and another for the the complex
                conjugate $\braket{\phi_j}{\phi_i}$.
                We can formulate the constraint for the real and imaginary part
                separately,
                \begin{align}
                    \Re\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    }
                    &=
                    \half\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                        + \braket{\phi_j}{\phi_i}
                    }
                    = 0,
                    \\
                    \Im\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    }
                    &=
                    \frac{1}{2i}\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                        - \braket{\phi_j}{\phi_i}
                    }
                    = 0.
                \end{align}
                Introducing two separate Lagrange multipliers $\mu_{ij}$ and
                $\nu_{ij}$ for the two latter conditions, we get
                \begin{align}
                    \mu_{ij}\Re\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    }
                    + \nu_{ij}\Im\brac{
                        \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    }
                    &=
                    \half\brak{
                        \mu_{ij} - i\nu_{ij}
                    }
                    \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    \nonumber
                    \\
                    &\qquad
                    + \half\brak{
                        \mu_{ij} + i\nu_{ij}
                    }
                    \braket{\phi_j}{\phi_i}.
                \end{align}
                We now choose our combined Lagrange multipliers to be
                \begin{align}
                    \lambda_{ji} &=
                    -\half\brak{
                        \mu_{ij} - i\nu_{ij}
                    }, \\
                    \lambda_{ij} &=
                    -\half\brak{
                        \mu_{ij} + i\nu_{ij}
                    },
                \end{align}
                which implies that $\lambda_{ji} = \lambda_{ij}^{*}$, which is
                what we wanted to show.
            \end{proof}

            We are now interested in finding a stationary point of the
            Lagrangian with respect to small variations in functional
            dependency, that is, the molecular orbitals and the Lagrange
            multipliers.
            The stationary conditions for the Lagrange multipliers yield the
            constraint that the molecular orbitals should be orthonormal, viz.
            \begin{gather}
                \dpd{}{\lambda_{ji}}\lagrangianfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}, \lambda}
                = 0
                \implies
                \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j} = \delta_{ij},
            \end{gather}
            which are included in the end when we find solutions that are
            orthonormal as the constraint is included in the variation over the
            molecular orbitals \cite{kvaal2017notes}.
            The variation over a specific orbital $k$ is given by
            \begin{align}
                \tilde{\phi}_i(x) = \phi_{i}(x) + \delta_{ik}\epsilon\eta(x),
            \end{align}
            where $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ is a small number and $\eta(x)$ is a
            single-particle function over some coordinate $x$.
            Note the use of the Kronecker-Delta to ensure that the variation
            only occurs for a single orbital at a time.
            This variation is similar for the complex conjugate of the
            molecular orbitals, but with $\phi^{*}_i(x)$ and $\eta^{*}(x)$
            instead.
            To avoid too much clutter, we will denote a variation over the
            molecular orbitals by a variation over the Slater determinants.
            That is, we take $\tilde{\Phi}(\vfg{x})$ to mean a variation over a
            single orbital $\phi_i(x)$ in $\Phi(\vfg{x})$, and similarly for the
            complex conjugate.
            Taylor expanding the Lagrangian functional,
            \begin{align}
                \lagrangianfunc{\tilde{\slat}, \tilde{\slat}^{*}, \lambda}
                &=
                \lagrangianfunc{\slat, \slat^{*}, \lambda}
                +
                \left.
                \dpd{
                    \lagrangianfunc{\tilde{\slat}, \slat^{*}, \lambda}
                }{\epsilon}
                \right\lvert_{\epsilon = 0}
                \epsilon
                \nonumber \\
                &\qquad
                +
                \left.
                \dpd{
                    \lagrangianfunc{\slat, \tilde{\slat}^{*}, \lambda}
                }{\epsilon}
                \right\lvert_{\epsilon = 0}
                \epsilon
                + \dots,
            \end{align}
            where the dots represent variations beyond the first order
            stationary condition.
            As discussed in the section on the variational principle, the first
            order variations does not guarantee that we have found a minimum,
            but they do it \emph{often enough} for us to not bother with second
            order variations or more \cite{szabo1996modern}.
            In lieu of this comforting thought, we proceed on our merry way by
            finding the stationary points using the method of functional
            derivatives as dicussed in \autoref{sec:variational-principle}.
            We will restrict ourselves to the variation over the complex
            conjugated orbitals as both variations yield the same equation
            adjointed of one another.
            % TODO: Is this an allowed word? Rethink this sentence.
            This yields
            \begin{align}
                \lagrangianfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}, \lambda}
                =
                \energyfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}}
                - \lambda_{ji}\brak{
                    \braket{\phi_i}{\phi_j}
                    + \epsilon \delta_{ik}\braket{\eta}{\phi_j}
                    - \delta_{ij}
                },
            \end{align}
            where we used the linearity of the inner product to split ut the
            variation over the orbital $\phi^{*}_i(x)$ in the constraint term.
            Keeping only first order variations in the energy functional we find
            \begin{align}
                \energyfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}}
                = \energyfunc{\Phi, \Phi^{*}}
                + \epsilon\para{
                    \mel{\eta}{\onehamil}{\phi_k}
                    + \mel{\eta\phi_j}{\twohamil}{\phi_k\phi_j}_{AS}
                }
                + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2),
            \end{align}
            where we've used the antisymmetric properties of the two-body
            elements to collect the two variations over the left-hand side of
            the matrix elements.
            Furthermore, we've collapsed one of the sums over the
            Kronecker-Delta in the variation in all terms.
            The variation in the Lagrangian functional can be now be found by
            \begin{align}
                \delta\lagrangianfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}, \lambda}
                &=
                \lagrangianfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}, \lambda}
                -
                \lagrangianfunc{\Phi, \Phi^{*}, \lambda}
                \\
                &=
                \epsilon\brak{
                    \mel{\eta}{\onehamil}{\phi_k}
                    +
                    \mel{\eta\phi_j}{\twohamil}{\phi_k\phi_j}_{AS}
                    - \lambda_{jk}
                    \braket{\eta}{\phi_j}
                }.
            \end{align}
            Having collapsed one of the orbital sums to yield $\phi_k$ we now
            restrict the variation over the molecular orbitals to
            \begin{align}
                \delta\phi^{*}_k(x)
                = \tilde{\phi}^{*}_k(x)
                - \phi^{*}_k(x)
                = \epsilon\eta^{*}(x).
            \end{align}
            Computing the stationary point of the Lagrangian with variations
            over $\phi^{*}_k(x)$ now gives
            \begin{gather}
                \int\dd x\frac{
                    \delta\lagrangianfunc{\Phi, \tilde{\Phi}^{*}, \lambda}
                }{\delta \phi^{*}_k(x)}
                \eta^{*}(x)
                = 0
                \\
                \implies
                \mel{\eta}{\onehamil}{\phi_k}
                + \mel{\eta\phi_j}{\twohamil}{\phi_k\phi_j}_{AS}
                = \lambda_{jk}\braket{\eta}{\phi_j},
                \label{eq:stationary-lagrangian}
            \end{gather}
            which according to the fundamental lemma of calculus
            \cite{wiki:fundamental-lemma} must be valid for all variations
            $\epsilon\eta^{*}(x)$.
            We now introduce the single-particle \emph{Fock operator} by
            its matrix elements
            \begin{align}
                \mel{\phi_p}{\fock}{\phi_q}
                \equiv
                \mel{\phi_p}{\onehamil}{\phi_q}
                +
                \mel{\phi_p\phi_j}{\twohamil}{\phi_q\phi_j}_{AS},
                \label{eq:fock-mel}
            \end{align}
            where we use the Fermi vacuum formalism for the sums.
            This lets us write the stationary point of the Lagrangian functional
            from \autoref{eq:stationary-lagrangian} as
            \begin{align}
                \fock\ket{\phi_k}
                = \lambda_{jk}\ket{\phi_j}.
                \label{eq:non-canonical-hartree-fock}
            \end{align}
            This equation is known as the \emph{non-canonical Hartree-Fock
            equations}, where the molecular orbitals $\phi_k$ are orthonormal.

        \subsection{Canonical Hartree-Fock equations}
            Now, \autoref{eq:non-canonical-hartree-fock} will yield the
            stationary Hartree-Fock energy, but from
            \autoref{lemma:unitary-transformation-slater} we know that a unitary
            transformation of the Slater determinant $\Phi(\vfg{x})$ leaves the
            determinant invariant up to a complex phase.
            We therefore look for a new set of spin-orbitals $\brac{\psi_p}$
            which will diagonalize the non-canonical Hartree-Fock equations.
            We define the unitary transformation from the non-canonical orbitals
            $\brac{\phi_p}$ to the new spin-orbitals by
            \begin{align}
                \ket{\psi_p} = U_{qp}\ket{\phi_q}
                \iff
                \ket{\phi_r} = U^{*}_{pr}\ket{\psi_p},
            \end{align}
            where $U_{qp}$ is an element in the unitary matrix $\vfg{U}$.
            From \autoref{lemma:unitary-transformation-orthonormality} we know
            that the new basis set $\brac{\psi_{p}}$ will preserve the
            orthonormality of the original basis set $\brac{\phi_q}$.
            We construct the Hermitian matrix $\vfg{\Lambda}$ from the Hermitian
            Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_{ji}$.
            From the Schur decomposition \cite{wiki:schur} we can write
            \begin{align}
                \vfg{\Lambda} = \vfg{U} \vfg{\energy} \vfg{U}^{\dagger},
            \end{align}
            where we from the spectral theorem know that the matrix
            $\vfg{\energy} = \diag(\epsilon_1, \dots)$ will be diagonal with the
            eigenvalues $\epsilon_m$ of $\vfg{\Lambda}$ on the diagonal
            \cite{wiki:spectral-theorem}.
            Using the Kronecker-Delta of rank 3 defined in
            \autoref{eq:rank-3-kd}, the Schur decomposition of the Lagrange
            multipliers then take on the form
            \begin{align}
                \lambda_{jk} = U_{ji} E_{il} U^{*}_{kl}
                = U_{ji} \delta^{m}_{il} \epsilon_m U^{*}_{kl}
                \implies
                \delta^{m}_{il} \epsilon_m
                = U^{*}_{ji} \lambda_{jk} U_{kl}.
            \end{align}
            Transforming from the non-canonical molecular orbitals in
            \autoref{eq:non-canonical-hartree-fock} to the new spin-orbital
            basis, we get
            \begin{gather}
                \fock\ket{\phi_k} = \lambda_{jk}\ket{\phi_j}
                \implies
                \fock U^{*}_{lk}\ket{\psi_{l}}
                = \lambda_{jk} U^{*}_{lj} \ket{\psi_l}
                \\
                \implies
                U^{*}_{lk} U_{km} \fock\ket{\psi_l}
                = U^{*}_{lj} \lambda_{jk} U_{km} \ket{\psi_l}
                \implies
                \delta_{ml} \fock \ket{\psi_l}
                = \delta^{n}_{lm} \epsilon_{n} \ket{\psi_l}
                \\
                \implies
                \fock\ket{\psi_m}
                = \epsilon_{m} \ket{\psi_m},
                \label{eq:canonical-hartree-fock}
            \end{gather}
            where we are left with the \emph{canonical Hartree-Fock equations},
            which constitutes an eigenvalue equation.
            It is worth re-iterating that the equations were found from first
            order variations in the variational principle and therefore does not
            guarantee that we have found a minimum.
            In order to categorize the stationary point we can perform higher order
            variations to determine if we have find a minimum, saddle point, or
            a maximum.
            However, we will not explore higher order variations any further.
            % TODO: Mention that the canonical Hartree-Fock equations reduce to
            % the Schrödinger equation when u = 0.

        \subsection{The mean-field approximation}
            It is worth discussing the Fock operator defined in
            \autoref{eq:fock-mel} in more detail.

        \subsection{Brillouin's theorem}
            Brillouin's theorem states that given an orthonormal single-particle
            basis $\brac{\ket{\phi_p}}_{i = 1}^{L}$, which is used to build a basis of
            Slater determinants $\brac{\ket{\Phi_I}}_{I = 1}^{N_s}$, then
            \begin{align}
                \bra{\Phi}\hamil\ket{\Phi^{a}_{i}} = 0,
            \end{align}
            is true iff the single-particle basis is found from solving the
            Hartree-Fock equations and $\ket{\Phi^{a}_{i}}$ is any singly
            excited determinant from the reference determinant $\ket{\Phi}$
            \cite{kvaal2017notes}.
            An important consequence of this is that all single excitations,
            from the reference state, can be neglected if we choose the
            Hartree-Fock reference state as our reference determinant.
            \begin{proof}
                We prove Brillouin's theorem directly by evaluating the matrix
                element
                \begin{align}
                    \bra{\Phi}\hamil\ket{\Phi^{a}_{i}}
                    &= \bra{\Phi}\onehamil\ket{\Phi^{a}_{i}}
                    + \frac{1}{4}\bra{\Phi}\twohamil\ket{\Phi^{a}_{i}}
                    = \oneten^{a}_{i} + \twoten^{aj}_{ij}
                    = \fockten^{a}_{i},
                \end{align}
                where we've used the Slater-Condon rules to evaluate the matrix
                elements.
                As the single-particle basis is the molecular orbitals found
                from solving the Hartree-Fock equations
                \begin{align}
                    \fock\ket{\phi_p} = \varepsilon_p\ket{\phi_p},
                \end{align}
                the Fock matrix is diagonal.
                This means that
                \begin{align}
                    \fockten^{a}_{i}
                    \equiv
                    \bra{\phi_a}\fock\ket{\phi_i}
                    = \varepsilon_i\braket{\phi_a}{\phi_i}
                    = 0,
                \end{align}
                as the molecular orbitals are orthonormal by construction.
            \end{proof}
