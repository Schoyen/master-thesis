    Given a basis of $L$ single particle functions $\ket{p}$ where
    \begin{align}
        \left\{\ket{p}\right\}_{p = 1}^{L}
        &=
        \left\{\ket{i}\right\}_{i = 1}^{N}
        \cup \left\{\ket{a}\right\}_{a = N + 1}^{L}.
    \end{align}
    Here $i, j, k, \dots$ represents the $N$ first occupied states of the
    reference Slater determinant whereas $a, b, c, \dots$ represent the
    remaining $M = L - N$ virtual states in the total basis $p, q, r,
    \dots$\footnote{Occupied and virtual states are also known as hole and
    particle states if we treat the reference Slater determinant as the
    \textit{Fermi level}}.
