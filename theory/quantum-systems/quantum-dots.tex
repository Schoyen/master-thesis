\section{Quantum dots}
    Artificial atoms, or the so-called quantum dots, constitute a hot topic in
    condensed matter physics and material sciences. We will be exploring
    several types of quantum dots in both one and two dimensions in this
    thesis. The difference between the types of quantum dots is found in the
    one-body potential. All of the dots share the characteristic of being in an
    infinite well which makes the systems \emph{bound}. In our study of systems
    subject to intense laser fields, this will prove to be a bad approximation
    when the laser becomes very strong as the particles have no way of being
    ionized, i.e., escape the potential well.  Even so, for weak laser fields
    and for ground state calculations, they serve as excellent candidates for
    our methods.

    \subsection{One-dimensional harmonic oscillator}
        One of the simplest theoretical models studied. The one-dimensional
        harmonic oscillator is usually one of the first models studied in
        undergraduate quantum mechanics courses. The one-body Hamiltonian of the
        one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by
        \begin{align}
            \onehamil = -\frac{\momentum^2}{2m} + \half m\omega^2 \position^2,
            \label{eq:1dho-hamiltonian}
        \end{align}
        where the latter term, i.e., the one-body potential, gives rise to the
        name of the system. Plugging this operator into the time-independent
        Schrödinger equation
        \begin{gather}
            \onehamil\ket{n} = \epsilon_n\ket{n},
        \end{gather}
        which results in an energy eigenvalue equation we wish to solve in order
        to find an expression for $\ket{n}$.
        % TODO: Discuss both the algebraic derivation and the solution using
        % diagonalization on a grid.
        % TODO: Include analytic solution to \ket{n}.
        % TODO: Include figues of the potential and the eigenstates.

    \subsection{One-dimensional double well quantum dot}
        A slightly more complicated model is the \emph{double well} quantum dot.
        Succintly named due to its ``bump'' in the bottom of the parabolic
        potential from the harmonic oscillator. The one-body hamiltonian is
        given by
        \begin{align}
            \onehamil = -\frac{\momentum^2}{2m}
            + \half m\omega^2\para{
                \position^2
                + \frac{1}{4}l^2
                - l\abs{\position}
            },
        \end{align}
        where $l$ is the ``width'' of the potential barrier in the bottom of the
        parabola.
        % TODO: What is the width? RMS?

    \subsection{Two-dimensional harmonic oscillator}
        The one-body Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is
        virtually identical to the one-body Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional
        harmonic oscillator, i.e., \autoref{eq:1dho-hamiltonian}, but with the
        position and momentum operators being represented in two-dimensions. We
        will be looking at a circular, symmetric potential. We will thus be
        working in a polar coordinate basis. The main reason we choose
        the polar coordinate representation is due to the evaluation of the
        two-body Coulomb integral elements. This is the most costly part of the
        construction of the matrix elements and in a polar basis we have
        \emph{analytical} expressions for these elements
        \cite{anisimovas1998energy}.  The Hamiltonian can thus be represented by
        \begin{align}
            \onehamil &= -\frac{\hslash^2}{2m}\vfg{\nabla}^2
            + \half m\omega^2\para{\position^2 + \position[y]^2}
            = -\frac{\hslash^2}{2m}\brak{
                \dpd[2]{}{r}
                + \frac{1}{r}\dpd[]{}{r}
                + \frac{1}{r^2}\dpd[2]{}{\theta}
            }
            + \half m \omega^2 \position[r]^2,
        \end{align}
        where $\position[r]^2 = \position^2 + \position[y]^2$. Next we insert
        the Hamiltonian into the time-independent Schrödinger equation
        \begin{align}
            \onehamil\ket{nm} = \epsilon_{nm}\ket{nm},
        \end{align}
        and diagonalize in order to find the eigenstates, $\ket{nm}$.
        Representing the eigenstates in polar coordinates
        \begin{align}
            \phi_{nm}(\vf{r}) = \phi_{nm}(r, \theta)
            \equiv \braket{r\theta}{nm},
        \end{align}
        we solve the eigenvalue problem by separating the radial and the angular
        part of the eigenstate and solve each term individually. That is,
        \begin{align}
            \phi_{nm}(r, \theta) = N_{nm}R_{nm}(r)\Theta_{m}(\theta).
        \end{align}
        % TODO: Complete this derivation, i.e., solve the differential equation and
        % find the normalization constant.
        % TODO: Talk about angular momentum.
        Solving the two coupled ordinary differential equations and finding the
        normalization constant, we find the terms
        \begin{align}
            N_{nm} = a\sqrt{\frac{n!}{\pi(n + \abs{m})!}},
        \end{align}
        as the normalization factor with
        \begin{align}
            a = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hslash}},
        \end{align}
        the Bohr radius. The radial contribution is given by
        \begin{align}
            R_{nm}(r)
            &= (ar)^{\abs{m}}L^{\abs{m}}_{n}(a^2r^2)
            \exp\brac{-\frac{a^2 r^2}{2}},
        \end{align}
        where $L^{m}_{n}(r)$ is the \emph{associated Laguerre polynomials}. The
        angular part is given by
        \begin{align}
            \Theta_m(\theta) = \exp\brac{im\theta}.
        \end{align}
        The eigenenergy, $\epsilon_{nm}$, of the two-dimensional eigenstates is
        given by
        \begin{align}
            \epsilon_{nm} = \hslash\omega\brak{
                2n + \abs{m} + 1
            }.
        \end{align}
        Staring at the eigenenergy equation we notice quite fast that the states
        are degenerate in the energy. A drawing of the first three energy levels
        with their corresponding quantum numbers is shown in
        \autoref{fig:2dho-energy-levels}.

            \caption{In this plot we can see the energy degeneracy of the lowest
            three energy levels in the two-dimensional quantum dot.  Each arrow
            representes a spin up or a spin down state with the quantum numbers
            $n$ and $m$ as listed below. This pattern goes on indefinitly with
            the addition of one bar (two oscillators) per level.}
            \label{fig:2dho-energy-levels}
        \end{figure}
        The basis functions are orthonormal. By including spin as a quantum
        number $\sigma$, we can represent this by
        \begin{align}
            \braket{n_1 m_1 \sigma_1}{n_2 m_2 \sigma_2}
            = \delta_{n_1 n_2}\delta_{m_1 m_2} \delta_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}.
        \end{align}

        \subsubsection{Mapping the quantum numbers to a single value}
            When working with second quantized operators, we distinguish single
            particle functions in a Slater determinant by a single index.
            Including spin in the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator
            eigenstates we have to deal with three quantum numbers $n$, $m$ and
            $\sigma$ per state.  We are thus interested in finding a mapping
            $(n, m) \mapsto p$ and the inverse mapping $p \mapsto (n,
            m)$\footnote{The spin quantum number is easiest to deal with in the
            end as we can double each dimension in every tensor and label all
            odd or even indices by a spin direction.}.  Due to the degeneracy of
            the eigenenergies such a mapping will not be unique. We thus have to
            decide in advance how we should count the basis states. In this
            thesis we choose the convention that we start from the lowest energy
            level and move up by counting from left to right. Tabulating
            \autoref{fig:2dho-energy-levels} we get the table shown in
            \autoref{tab:2dho-mapping}.
            \begin{table}
                \centering
                \caption{In this table we show an example of how our mapping
                convention will index the states shown in
                \autoref{fig:2dho-energy-levels}.}
                \begin{tabular}{c|ll}
                    $\epsilon_{nm}$ & $(n, m)$ & $p$ \\
                    \hline
                    \\

            In \autoref{alg:nm-to-p} we give a sketch of the algorithm we use
            to compute $(n, m) \mapsto p$.
