\chapter{Quantum systems}
    In this chapter we'll discuss different quantum systems which will be
    explored. We'll be discussing the one-body part of the systems and explore
    how we can construct basis sets from the different systms. Furthermore,
    we'll be discussing how we can construct expectation values of different
    operators such as the dipole moment and the two-body Coulomb interaction.

    % TODO: Discuss short why we've chosen the basis sets we have
    Much of the limitation of good basis sets to be used in our methods comes
    from the calculation of the two-body matrix elements.
