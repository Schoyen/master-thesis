    theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus

    \section{Spin-orbitals}
        In this thesis we will be looking at many-particle systems. Wave
        functions of many-particle systems depend on the coordinates of all the
        particles contained in the system. We will typically build the wave
        functions of the full system from \emph{single particle functions}. In
        this work we'll limit our attention to particles with spin one half ,
        i.e., fermions, which means that the total wave function must satisfy
        the \emph{Pauli exclusion principle}. The single particle functions
        will as a consequence depend on the particle's spatial
        orientation\footnote{Note that this covers both position and momentum
        space as well as an arbitrary dimensionality.} and spin. We call
        these wave functions \emph{spin-orbitals}. In a functional basis we
        denote the spin-orbitals by
        \begin{align}
            \psi(x) \equiv \psi(\vf{r}, \sigma) = \psi(\vf{r})\ket{\sigma},
        \end{align}
        where $\vf{r}$ is a spatial position and $\sigma \in \brac{\upspin,
        \downspin}$, is either spin up, $\upspin$, or spin down, $\downspin$.
        For brevity we introduce $x = (\vf{r}, \sigma)$ as a generalized
        coordinate. A general spin-orbital can be written as a linear
        combination of two spatial orbitals\footnote{We will refer to the
        spatial part of a spin-orbital simply as an orbital.} where each orbital
        is combined with a spin direction. %TODO: Re-phrase this sentence.  This
        can be represented by
        \begin{align}
            \psi(x)
            &= \psi_1(\vf{r})\ket{\upspin} + \psi_2(\vf{r})\ket{\downspin}
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \psi_1(\vf{r}) \\
                \psi_2(\vf{r})
            \end{pmatrix},
        \end{align}
        where we've in the last equation expressed the two spin directions as
        unit vectors in two-dimensional vector space\footnote{The choice which
        spin direction will be which unit vector is arbitrary. Feel free to
        create any orthonormal unit vectors in two dimensions.}, viz.
        \begin{align}
            \ket{\upspin}
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                1 \\
                0
            \end{pmatrix},
            \qquad
            \ket{\downspin}
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                0 \\
                1
            \end{pmatrix}.
        \end{align}
        % TODO: Reconsider use of kets when representing the wavefunction in a
        % functional basis.

    \section{Second quantization}

    \section{Density matrices}
        When working with many-body quantum mechanics, computing expectation
        values can at times prove easier when done using density matrices. A
        general density matrix of a \emph{pure state} is on the form
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi},
        \end{align}
        that is, a pure state is a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ containing the
        maximum amount of information about a given system. For a \emph{mixed
        state}, i.e., a linear combination of pure states $\ket{\psi_k}$ with a
        classical probability $p_k$ associated with the state, we get a density
        matrix on the form
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \sum_{k} p_k \ket{\psi_k}\bra{\psi_k}.
        \end{align}
        Any density operator must satisfy the following
        properties \cite{modern-qm}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hermiticity, that is
                \begin{align}
                    p_k = p_k^{*} \implies \densitymatrix = \densitymatrix^{\dagger}.
                \end{align}
                This translates to the probabilities being real, $p_k \in
                \mathbb{R}$.
            \item Positivity,
                \begin{align}
                    p_k \geq 0 \implies \bra{\chi}\densitymatrix\ket{\chi} \geq 0.
                \end{align}
                In other words, density matrices are \emph{positive
                semidefinite}.
            \item Normalization of the probabilities,
                \begin{align}
                    \sum_{k} p_k = 1 \implies \tr(\densitymatrix),
                \end{align}
                that is, the probabilities must sum up to one.
        \end{enumerate}
        Furthermore, by squaring the density matrix and taking the trace we can
        infer if the system we are perusing is in a mixed state or a pure state
        \cite{modern-qm}.
        \begin{align}
            \tr(\densitymatrix^2) = \sum_{k} p_k^2 \leq 1,
        \end{align}
        with equality if, and only if, the system is in a pure state, viz.
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}
            \implies \densitymatrix^2 = \densitymatrix
            \implies \tr(\densitymatrix^2) = 1.
        \end{align}
        Using density matrices, we can compute the expectation value of any
        operator $\hat{O}$, by \cite{modern-qm}
        \begin{align}
            \expv{\hat{O}} = \tr(\hat{O}\densitymatrix).
        \end{align}
        % TODO: Work this out further

        \subsection{Many-body density matrices}
            In a seminal paper by Löwdin \cite{lowdin-density-matrices}, the
            concept of a many-body density matrix in terms of the orbitals of a
            Slater determinant is discussed. These are dubbed $N$-body density
            matrices, where $N$ depends on the $N$-body interaction, that is,
            the number of particles included in the interaction. Of the most
            useful for our work, we have the one- and two-body density matrices.
            As we will work almost exclusively in second quantization, we will
            follow the derivation of the one- and two-body density matrices done
            by \citeauthor{helgaker-molecular}. Löwdin's paper
            \cite{lowdin-density-matrices} did not employ second quantization,
            and all matrices are expressed in the coordinate representation. We
            will list these as they arrive.
