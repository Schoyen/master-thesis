    \epigraph{The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical
    theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus
    completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of
    these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble.}

    \section{Spin-orbitals}
        In this thesis we will be looking at many-particle systems. This means
        that we will have multiple wave functions, the so called
        \emph{spin-orbitals}, serving as building blocks for a total
        \emph{antisymmetric} wavefunction of the full system.

    \section{Density matrices}
        When working with many-body quantum mechanics, computing expectation
        values can at times prove easier when done using density matrices. A
        general density matrix of a \emph{pure state} is on the form
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi},
        \end{align}
        that is, a pure state is a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ containing the
        maximum amount of information about a given system. For a \emph{mixed
        state}, i.e., a linear combination of pure states $\ket{\psi_k}$ with a
        classical probability $p_k$ associated with the state, we get a density
        matrix on the form
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \sum_{k} p_k \ket{\psi_k}\bra{\psi_k}.
        \end{align}
        Any density operator must satisfy the following
        properties \cite{modern-qm}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Hermiticity, that is
                \begin{align}
                    p_k = p_k^{*} \implies \densitymatrix = \densitymatrix^{\dagger}.
                \end{align}
                This translates to the probabilities being real, $p_k \in
                \mathbb{R}$.
            \item Positivity,
                \begin{align}
                    p_k \geq 0 \implies \bra{\chi}\densitymatrix\ket{\chi} \geq 0.
                \end{align}
                In other words, density matrices are \emph{positive
                semidefinite}.
            \item Normalization of the probabilities,
                \begin{align}
                    \sum_{k} p_k = 1 \implies \tr(\densitymatrix),
                \end{align}
                that is, the probabilities must sum up to one.
        \end{enumerate}
        Furthermore, by squaring the density matrix and taking the trace we can
        infer if the system we are perusing is in a mixed state or a pure state
        \cite{modern-qm}.
        \begin{align}
            \tr(\densitymatrix^2) = \sum_{k} p_k^2 \leq 1,
        \end{align}
        with equality if, and only if, the system is in a pure state, viz.
        \begin{align}
            \densitymatrix = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}
            \implies \densitymatrix^2 = \densitymatrix
            \implies \tr(\densitymatrix^2) = 1.
        \end{align}
        Using density matrices, we can compute the expectation value of any
        operator $\hat{O}$, by \cite{modern-qm}
        \begin{align}
            \expv{\hat{O}} = \tr(\hat{O}\densitymatrix).
        \end{align}

        \subsection{Many-body density matrices}
            In a seminal paper by Löwdin \cite{lowdin-density-matrices}, the
            concept of a many-body density matrix in terms of the orbitals of a
            Slater determinant is discussed. These are dubbed $N$-body density
            matrices, where $N$ depends on the $N$-body interaction, that is,
            the number of particles included in the interaction. Of the most
            useful for our work, we have the one- and two-body density matrices.
            As we will work almost exclusively in second quantization, we will
            follow the derivation of the one- and two-body density matrices done
            by \citeauthor{helgaker-molecular}. Löwdin's paper
            \cite{lowdin-density-matrices} did not employ second quantization,
            and all matrices are expressed in the coordinate representation. We
            will list these as they arrive.
